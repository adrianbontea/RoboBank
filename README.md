# RoboBank
RoboBank is a leaning project. It started as a technical test that I took from a company a while ago but it quickly evolved into a learning project that I've been using to explore various technical patterns, principles, practices and technologies as the domain and the uses cases were already familiar.

From a functional perspective RoboBank is a simplified banking system. It is meant to handle the needs of a multinational bank in a simplistic way.

Initial Functional Requirements:

1. Need a customer banking portal with the following facilities
 - Intra-bank account-to-account money transfers. These transfers could be made between bank accounts across countries in different currencies. The bank charges 2% for currency exchange. The bank does not maintain currency rates and instead wants to use an online API.
 - The customer receives a guaranteed, but may be delayed, email alert for every transaction in his accounts.
 - The portal supports authentication from any one external provider like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google.
2. Need an application that could be installed on the bank's ATM machines (windows desktop based). Shall support basic operations like balance check, withdrawal, PIN change, etc.
3. Need a bill payment system. Using this system external websites are able to integrate online payment facility for this bank.
